## Neovim configuration fork of apha2phi
Original article from alpha2phi on his config: [Medium article](https://alpha2phi.medium.com/neovim-init-lua-e80f4f136030).

In order to get started with the new lua way I dared to copy and adapt this very decent config,
which honestly I couldn't have done on my own.

By now 

... November 2023
I got a super loaded frontend config for mostly Typescript/Javascript & Co. Frontend Development.
Additionally there's some stuff for clojure development and dart/flutter development.

What's in there:
* telescope
* nice lsp setup and completion setup for web frontend development (mostly)
* nice structure for custom personal utilities
* custom vimode colors and such (mostly for the different bars: buffer/tabline, winbar, statusline)
* nice mnemonic shortcut system
* telekasten (telescope driven zettelkasten variant; for markdown org-mode like note taking)
* preview plugins and shortcuts and jump/bookmark mnemonics for an optimised workflow
* many a plugin that makes this and that nicer
* custom personal colorscheme and a lot of other colorschemes (eg.: collection of themer color-themes)
...

What's missing/on my wishlist:
* Debugging setup
* Testing setup
* Default layout configurations (maybe with folke/edge)
* Default custom workflow modes (maybe with hydra?)
* custom clickable winbars
* some bugs in tabline UI
